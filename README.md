### Overwriting Existing Requirements

If you need to overwrite an existing `requirements.txt` file:

```bash
pipreqs /path/to/your/project --force
```

### Custom Output File

To specify a different name for your output file:

```bash
pipreqs /path/to/your/project --output custom_requirements.txt
```
